The main objective of this project was to get a hands on experience on MCP(Model Context Protocol). The use-case considered as part of this project was Google Maps. I wanted to talk to google map, the way I would talk to a local travel guide of any city. With the implementation of MCP I can make use of something like "Claude Desktop" to talk to google maps in plain english language, on line with something like: "Hey google maps can you find me restaurants near by, where they specialize-in and serve good korean food! The place needs to be open now, and also the place should highly rated within a vicinity of 2 km around Eindhoven central"
